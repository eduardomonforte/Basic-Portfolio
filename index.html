        <p>My name is Eduardo. I suck at writing, which is why I made the smart choice of studying Literature fresh out of high school – that only lasted 9 months. I like to call that period my <a href="http://ultimateclassicrock.com/john-lennon-lost-weekend/">"Lost Weekend"</a>, although is wasn't <a href="http://ultimateclassicrock.com/john-lennon-ufo/">as epic as John Lennon's</a> and, in hindsight, I realized you have to be truly lost in order to find yourself. More smart decisions followed: I started studying a B.A. in Communication shortly after, and I managed to see it all the way through, becoming my career's student body president in my last year of college.</p>
        <p>After finally getting my super useful degree, destiny willed it that I would be hired as a writer in a design agency, even though – as we've previously established – I suck at writing. I managed to not make a fool of myself during that time, but I eventually realized that I wasn't having fun doing it, and I wanted to pursue new things to suck at. That's how I decided to learn coding: so that I can maybe use this new skill to have fun, found a startup and make it suck, big time.</p>
